# JENGINE v0.3

JEngine is a streamlined and easy-to-use framework.

JEngine has its own behaviour based on MonoBehaviour but much more friendly to manage lifecycle. (You can make loop easier using JEngine).

JEngine has a method-chaining style of coding, which makes your code much more stramlined and beautiful.

JEngine supports hot update, which is base on [XAsset](https://github.com/xasset/xasset) & [ILRuntime](https://github.com/Ourpalm/ILRuntime) which supports hot-update codes and resources in Unity.

JEngine has its own purpose to help developers write powerful codes which are streamlined and beautiful; and to help developers distibute their games easier (eg. hot update).

## What is Hot update

As we acknowledged, when developers update their apps/games, users will have to download the latest version from app stores, this is what we called "cold-update". Hot-update, sounds like a antonym of normal update process, it is a way which developers upload their newest codes & resources into their web server, and since users open their apps/games, they automatically download the latest codes and resources from the server, and those codes and resources reloads, overrides the old versions.

It sounds simple right? But it is **actually not** easy to implement.

In the old days, we can use a technology which is called "JIT" to implement hot-update, but then App Store blocks this way as their hardware doesn't supports JIT, which means developers needs to find a new way to solve it out.

There are two main ways to implement hot-update:

1. Use Lua

   - Lua is a script language just like javascript, when Unity loads the game, this solution will make a virtual environment which runs those lua codes
   - Lua files are just like other text files, it ends with .lua and can be readed as TextAsset
   - You have to learn Lua first to use this solution

2. Use ILRuntime

   - ILRuntime is a solution which loads dll (What you can get after you build your c# soulution) in game and loads the methods in it

   - ILRuntime runs faster then lua except doing calculation
   - ILRuntime is written in c# and easy to use, that is the reason why JEngine is based on ILRuntime, not Lua

## Quick Start

#### Basics

> The basics tells you how to use this framework in basics

1. Clone this project

2. Open **ClonedProject/Assets** via Unity

3. Go to **HotUpdateResources/DLL & HotUpdateResources/Scene**, make sure you have **HotUpdateScripts.dll & Game.unity**

   <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/Ut6vWR.png" alt="check1" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%" />

   <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/UtcFTe.png" alt="check2" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%" />

4. On top menu, select **JEngine/XAsset/Build Bundles**

   <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/Ut6qwF.png" alt="menu" style="width:75%;margin-left:12.5%" />

5. Once it has built, upload your the whole **DLC** directory into your server (If you don't know how to do it, google search how to build a web server)

6. Go to **Init scene** in Unity, choose **Updater** in hierarchy

   <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/UtcuOf.png" alt="hierarchy" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%" />

7. In Inspector, change **Base URL** to your web host address which can locates hot-update files

   > Format: http://your-ip:your-port/DLC/ or http://your-domain/DLC/
   >
   > <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/16/UBC5uD.png" alt="inspector" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%" />

8. Now, run your game, and you will feel how hot-update works!

   > Note that stuffs shown in Unity Demo is in Chinese and will supports English in the future



#### Extensions

> The extensions will show you how to hot-update your game in coding levels

1. Open **ClonedProject/HotUpdateScripts/HotUpdateScripts.sln**
2. Find **Program.cs** and open it
3. Change something but **DO NOT DELETE** *RunGame()* Method
4. **Build Solution**
5. Go back to Unity, **redo step 4 & 5 in the Basics**
6. Run Game, and you will see the differences which you made



#### Developement Guide

> This will enable you quick develop your game and you don't need to upload your latest hot-update resources into your server **(which saves your time)**

1. Go to Unity Editor, open **Init scene**

2. Choose **Updater** from inspector

3. **Enable development mode** in Updater script section

   <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/16/UBC5uD.png" alt="guide1" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%" />



#### Common "Bugs"

- Cannot find Delegate Adapter for: **XXX**, Please add following code into Assets/Scripts/Init.cs 'InitializeILRuntime()' Method:

  > Just do what it asked you to add into **Scripts/Init.cs,  'InitializeILRuntime()' Method**
  >
  > ![bug1](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/Ut2RoD.png)



## Using JEngine Features in Hot Updatable Scripts

#### JEngine.UI

> JEngine now contains a new class which enhance the productivity of your UI (Only Supports Text at the moment)
>
> Why choose JEngine.UI?
>
> - Method-Chaning coding
> - Simple but powerful

1. In your Hot Update Scripts, and in your c# file, add the import at the top:

   ```c#
   using JEngine.UI;
   ```

2. Create a JUI with **AddComponent<T>** Method:

   ```c#
   //Here it is an example of JUIText
   JUIText t = GameObject.Find("Canvas/Text").AddComponent<JUIText>();
   ```

3. You can choose whether to give this JUI actions:

   ```c#
   //To Init it
    t.onInit(t =>
             {
               
             });
   
   //To Run it
    t.onRun(t =>
             {
               
             });
   
   //To Loop it
    t.onLoop(t =>
             {
               
             });
   
   //When it has ended
    t.onEnd(t =>
             {
               
             });
   ```

4. **To activate the JUI (IMPORTANT)**:

   ```c#
   t.Activate();
   ```

5. **All done!** (Remember to call **Activate** method when if you want to activate a JUI)

##### Extension

1. Method Chaining:

   ```
   JUIText t = GameObject.Find("Canvas/Text").AddComponent<JUIText>()
                   .onInit(t1 =>
                   {
                   
                   })
                   .onRun(t2 =>
                   {
                   })
                   .onLoop(t3 =>
                   {
                   })
                   .onEnd(t4 =>
                   {
                   })
                   .Activate();
   ```

2. Example:

   ```c#
   public class Example
       {
           public void Start()
           {
               int i = 0;
               JUIText t = GameObject.Find("Canvas/Text").AddComponent<JUIText>()
                   .onInit(t1 =>
                   {
                       t1.Text.text = "I have been Inited!";
                       Debug.Log(t1.Text.text);
                   })
                   .onRun(t2 =>
                   {
                       t2.Text.text = "I am Running!";
                       Debug.Log(t2.Text.text);
   
                       //Set the loop mode and frequency
                       t2.frame = false;//Run in milliseconds
                       t2.frequency = 1000;//Run in every 1000 ms (1 second)
   
                       UnityEngine.Object.Destroy(t2.gameObject,6);
                   })
                   .onLoop(t3 =>
                   {
                       i++;
                       t3.Text.text = "This is the " + i + " times that I changed!";
                       if (i >= 5)
                       {
                           t3.Text.text = "I will be destoryed in 1 second!";
                       }
                   })
                   .onEnd(t4 =>
                   {
                       Debug.Log("My lifecycle has been ended!");
                   })
                   .Activate();
           }
       }
   ```

3. Controls the frequency of a loop:

   **JUI** inherits from **JUIBehaviour**, which can manage the mode and frequency of loop.

   - **frame** is a bool value which holds whether the loop runs in frames or in milliseconds
   - **frequency** is a int value which holds the interval of loops (in frame counts when **frame** is true or in milliseconds)



#### JUIBehaviour

> JEngine now contains a **new behaviour** base on MonoBehaviour but **runs better**
>
> Why choose JUIBehaviour?
>
> - Simple lifecycle
> - Less codes to implement loops
> - Uses coroutine rather than methods to do updates

1. In your Hot Update Scripts, and in your c# file:

   Add import at the top:

   ```c#
   using JEngine.LifeCycle;
   ```

2. Inherit **JUIBehaviour** in your class

   ```c#
   namespace HotUpdateScripts
   {
       public class Sample : JUIBehaviour
       {
       	//ToDo
       }
   }
   ```

3. There are four main methods in **JUIBehaviour**

   - Init => When this class has been added to an Unity GameObject
   - Run => This method will be called after Init
   - Loop => This method will loop in specific mode and specific frequency
   - End => Will be called when the GameObject with this class has been destoryed

4. Example Showcase:

   ```c#
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.UI;
   using JEngine.LifeCycle;
   
   namespace HotUpdateScripts
   {
       public class Sample : JUIBehaviour
       {
           public Text HelloText;
   
           public int times;
   
           public override void Init()
           {
               HelloText = GameObject.Find("Canvas/Text").GetComponent<Text>();
               times = 0;
           }
   
           public override void Run()
           {
               //Here in run method, we set up the frequency and mode of loop.
   
               frame = false;// Not loop in frame, but in milliseconds
               frequency = 1000;//Loop in 1000ms => 1 second
   
               /* OR:
                * frame = true;// Loop in frame
                * frequency = 10;//Loop in every 10 frames
                */
           }
   
           public override void Loop()
           {
               HelloText.text = "HELLO JEngine * " + times + " times";
               times++;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. As you might see, in **Run** method, there is an assignment of **frame and frequency** variable, these variables controls **loop** method.

   - frame: **bool**, when it is true, loop runs in **frames**; or loop runs in **milliseconds** 
   - frequency: **int**, it holds the **interval of frames or milliseconds** which calls loop method
