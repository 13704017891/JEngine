# JENGINE v0.3.6.1

JEngine is a **streamlined and easy-to-use** framework designed for Unity Programmers.

What can JEngine do?

- **Own behaviour** based on MonoBehaviour
  
  - **More friendly to manage lifecycle**
    
    - You can make loop easier using JEngine
    
    ```c#
    public class JBehaviourExample : JBehaviour
    {
      public override void Init()
      {
        base.Init();
        ...
      }
      
      public override void Run()
      {
        base.Run();
        ...
      }
      
      public override void Loop()
      {
        ...
      }
      
      public override void End()
      {
        ...
      }
    }
    ```
    
    
  
- **Own UI solution**
  
  - **Method-Chaining** style makes codes prettier and easier to visualize
  
    ```c#
    var JUI = Showcase.AddComponent<JUI>()
      .onInit(t =>
              {
                ...
              })
      .onLoop(t1 =>
              {
                ...
              })
      .onEnd(t2 =>
             {
               ...
             })
      .Activate();
    ```
  
    
  
  - **Easier to manage** lifecycle
    
    - Can **easily set up** **what** you want the UI element **to do in specific time**
    
    ```c#
    t.FrameMode = false;//Run in ms
    t.Frequency = 1000;//Loop each 1s
    ```
    
    
    
  - **Bindable to data**
    
    - **UI can be binded to a data**, once data  has changed, it will call the method that you has binded
    
    ```c#
    var JUI = b.AddComponent<JUI>()
      .Bind(data.b)
      .onMessage(t1 =>
                 {
                   ...
                 })
      .Activate();
    ```
    
    
    
  - Supports any UIBehaviour objects
  
    ```c#
    t1.Element<UIBehaviour>()
    ```
  
- Own **Action solution**
  
  - **Less code, does more**
    
    ```c#
    JAction j = new JAction();
    j.Do(() =>
          {
            Log.Print("Hello from JAction!");
          })
      .Delay(3.0f)
      .Do(() =>
          {
            Log.Print("Bye from JAction");
          })
      .Excute();
    ```
    
    
  
- **Hot-update solution**
  
  - **Resource hot update & management** is based on **[XAsset](https://github.com/xasset/xasset)** which JEngine's author has contributed into.
  - **Code hot update** is based on **[ILRuntime](https://github.com/Ourpalm/ILRuntime)** which JEngine's author has also contributed into.
  - **Encrypts** your hot-updatable **codes and resources**, codes will go into your assetbundles, assetbundles will be encrypt within **VFS by XAsset**, and also, your **codes will be encrypted in AES-128 ECB mode**
  
- <u>**More to explore!!!**</u>

JEngine has its own purpose to help developers **write powerful codes which are streamlined and beautiful**; and to **help developers easier making their games**.

**If you enjoy using JEngine, please give this repo a star!**

## Latest Features

- **[JAction](JAction.md)** supports more features

  - Repeat with frequency

    ```c#
    int repeatCounts = 3;
    float repeatDuration = 0.5f;
    JAction j = new JAction();
    j.Repeat(() =>
           {
             Log.Print("I have repeated");
           }, repeatCounts, repeatDuration)
      .Excute();
    ```

  - Repeat with condition

    ```c#
    int num = 10;
    float repeatDuration = 0.5f;
    float timeout = 10f;
    JAction j = new JAction();
    j.RepeatWhen(() =>
                 {
                   Log.Print($"num is more than 0, num--");
                   num--;
                 },
                 () => num > 0, repeatDuration, timeout)
      .Excute();
    ```

  - Repeat until

    ```c#
    int num = 10;
    float repeatDuration = 0.5f;
    float timeout = 10f;
    JAction j = new JAction();
    j.RepeatUntil(() =>
                 {
                   Log.Print($"num is more than 0, num--");
                   num--;
                 },
                 () => num <= 0, repeatDuration, timeout)
      .Excute();
    ```

    

  - Wait Until

    ```c#
    JAction j = new JAction();
    j.Until(()=> something is done)
      .Do(something)
      .Excute();
    ```

## Features

- **[Hot-update](WhyHotUpdate.md)** solution

  - No need to learn Lua, **C# codes can be hot-updated**
  - Drop your resources in specific directories and can be **generate hot-updatable resources automatically**, all you need to do is to press "Build Bundle" button, and to put  your what it generated into your server
  - **Encrypts DLL**, your hot-update codes are safe now unless someone got your encrypted password

<br>

- **[JBehaviour](JBehaviour.md)** is a Behaviour in JEngine  which is based on MonoBehaviour, and it is **easier to manage lifecycle** of UI elements

<br>

- **[JUI](JUI.md)** is a class in JEngine which can **enhance the performence of UI** elements based on UGUI
  - JUI borrowed concept from **MVVM Framework** and rewrote it, JUI supports **binding a data with an action,** once data has changed, the action will be called
  - You can choose to **either update your UI in specific Loop** with Frequency, or to update your UI only if the binded data changed
  - You can **get UI components more efficiently** with JUI via the generic method **Method<T>**
  
- **Method-Chaning** style of coding makes your codes **prettier and easier to read**

<br>

- **[GUI-Redis](https://github.com/JasonXuDeveloper/Unity-GUI-Redis)** helps visualize data in Redis Databases and can **modify data** in it.
  - Supports connect through **SSH tunnel**
  - Supports connect through **normay way** (IP, Port connection)
  - Supports **add/modify/delete/search** key-value pairs

<br>

- **[JAction](JAction.md)** is an extension of Action

  - **Method-chaining** Style

  - Great variation of features

    - Do action
  - Delay
    - Wait Until
    - Repeat
    - Repeat When
    - Repeat Until
  
  - **Shorter and more powerful**
  
    - Less code can do more things
  
    ```c#
    int num = 0;
    int repeatCounts = 3;
    float repeatDuration = 0.5f;
    float timeout = 10f;
    JAction j = new JAction();
  
    j.Do(() => Log.Print("Hello from JAction!"))
      .Repeat(() =>
              {
                num++;
                Log.Print($"num is: {num}");
              }, repeatCounts, repeatDuration)
      .Do(() => Log.Print($"num has increased {repeatCounts} times"))
      .RepeatWhen(() =>
                  {
                    Log.Print($"num is more than 0, num--");
                    num--;
                  },
                  () => num > 0, repeatDuration, timeout)
      .Do(() => Log.Print("JAction will do something else in 3 seconds"))
      .Delay(3.0f)
      .Do(() => Log.Print("Bye from JAction"))
      .Excute();
    ```
  
  - **Extension of System.Action**
  
    - Add what to do, add delayings, JAction will do them in order
    ```

<br>

- **Object Pool** solution

  - **MUCH MORE Enhances the performence** rather than using ***Instantiate method***
    - With this solution, **you don't have to repeat instantiate gameObject**
    - Just **tell JObjectPool what gameObject you will repeatedly create**, and **how many you except to create at the start**, it will do it for you
    - Request **PoolObject** to get the GameObject
  - Easy and powerful
  - With algorithm which fairly controls gameObjects

  > Example will come soon



## Future Features

- ~~Supports local hot-update resources development in Unity Editor (Done)~~
- ~~Encrypt Hot-update DLL and decrypt in runtime~~
- ~~Object Pool which significantly improves performance rather than using Instantiate method~~
- JUI with more extended APIs
- UI Special Effects
- Optiimize logics which can improve process speed (As always doing it)
- *Unity Editor FTP Tool (Maybe)*

## JEngine Hot Update Logics

![flowchart](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/Uthp6A.png)



## Quick Start

#### Basics

> The basics tells you how to use this framework in basics (How to make your project hot-updatable)

[Click here to have a read](Basic.md)

#### Extensions

> The extensions will show you how to hot-update your game in coding levels (How to make hot-updatable codes)

[Click here to have a read](Extension.md)



#### Developement Guide

> This will enable you quick develop your game and you don't need to upload your latest hot-update resources into your server **(which saves your time)**

1. Go to Unity Editor, open **Init scene**

2. Choose **Updater** from inspector

3. **Enable development mode** in Updater script section

   <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/16/UBC5uD.png" alt="guide1" style="width:50%;margin-left:25%" />



#### Common "Bugs"

- Cannot find Delegate Adapter for: **XXX**, Please add following code into Assets/Scripts/Init.cs 'InitializeILRuntime()' Method:

  > Just do what it asked you to add into **Scripts/Init.cs,  'InitializeILRuntime()' Method**
  >
  > ![bug1](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/14/Ut2RoD.png)



#### IMPORTANT

- When **building bundle**, a window will pop up, and you need to **provide the encrypt key which encrypts your dll**

  ![key1](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/26/apuoHs.png)
  
- In **Init scene**, select HotFixCode on hierarchy, you will see **Init (Script) on inspector**, there will be a section called **Key**, just **fill the encrypt key** in, and it will decrypt dll in runtime

  ![key2](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/26/apu7En.png)

- When you build your project, **remember to remove hot-update scenes** in build setting panel to avoid redundancy

  ![build](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/07/20/Uhxcuj.jpg)



## Development Environment

- Debuging Unity Engine Version: 2019.3.13f1
